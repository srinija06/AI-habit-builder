2. Emotional-Adaptive Habit Engine

A daily emotional check-in powers dynamic habit adjustment.
Users type one sentence about how they feel; the AI adjusts the day’s routine based on energy and emotional state.

Input: “Feeling stressed”
AI Response: “Your tasks are adjusted to lighter, calming activities for today.”
